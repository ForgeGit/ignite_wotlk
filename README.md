## Munching - The hidden DPS loss of Ignite 

#### **Tl,dr:** __Ignite **munching**__ happens randomly to your ignite damage, and __it is a DPS loss__. More frequent on TTW Mages than FFB mages. As TTW, you can minimize its effects with a WA and/or a macro.

Ignite munching is a __well-documented bug [1,2,3] that can cause a loss of DPS__ for Fire Mages due to how spell interactions work. 

In short, **munching** happens in mostly 2 scenarios:

1. Living Bomb explosion crits while a Fireball or Frostfire Bolt crit is landing or another crit is happening.
    - Ignite from the Living Bomb explosion gets munched. 

2. Cast Pyroblast immediately after a Fireball (Hot Streak) and both are crits when landing.
    - Ignite from the fireball will be munched 

Scenario #2 is more frequently observed among TTW Mages because they mainly cast fireball (ofc!) 

Frostfire bolt has a different travel time, making it less likely to happen. It CAN and WILL happen, but less often and rarer.

The effects of this bug on TTW mages can be mitigated by using WAs and macros. 
You can check the FAQ or the commands "!munch" and "!fuckmunch" on [Mage Discord](https://discord.gg/eszwRckRmA) for more details.

## Vomit: When Ignite goes wrong for the best

A less well-documented Ignite bug in Wrath of the Lich King is the opposite of Ignite Munch (from now on, "Ignite Vomit"), which allows an ignite to keep rolling and result in an additional tick that should not have occurred.

This bug has been  discussed in an [ElitistJerk forum thread in 2008 [1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20100412150438/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t19766-mage_rolling_ignites_they_back/), and the first documented claim for it can be traced back to another [ElitistJerk thread in 2007[2]] (https://web.archive.org/web/20110810120414/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t12302-mage_ignites_working_correctly/).

Additionally, a brief explanation of the bug can be found in the [wowwiki section for Ignite Bugs, under the section "Known Bugs"](https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Ignite_(old)#Past_changes). 

Unlike "Ignite Munching", which is a bug interaction with a section named for its own in the wiki, Ignite Vomit is just described in a one paragraph as something that can happen, but that should not be confused with the old "rolling" ignite system from pre-2.0 (known to us as "Classic").
